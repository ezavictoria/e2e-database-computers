# e2e-database-computers
 Automation project with Cypress and Cucumber

## Test script
Tests can be run using "npm run test" in the terminal

## Observations
Despite the successful add message, the computer does not appear in the list and so the first test fails

## Comments
I decided to test it this way because I validated the creation, the error messages, the field validations and the search in the computer database listing in two scenarios.
